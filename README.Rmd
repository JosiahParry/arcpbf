# arcpbf

`{arcpbf}` is an R package that processes Esri Protocol Buffers. It is written
in Rust and powered by the [extendr](https://github.com/extendr/extendr) library.




## Internals 

Internally, there is a rust crate [`esripbf`](./src/rust/esripbf) which is a
a Rust library built with [`prost`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost) to handle the [FeatureCollection Protocol Buffer Specification](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-pbf/tree/main/proto/FeatureCollection).


## Notes

Alternatively, it may make sense to write to a geoarrow array and convert to sfc 
using {wk}. These are just thoughts.
